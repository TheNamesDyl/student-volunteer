        Our initial product seeks to optimize the connection between skilled volunteers and technology-for-good projects. Later offerings will focus on the needs of donors, citizens, and institutions.
        
        The result of our work will be an increase in transparency, participation and collaboration within the civic tech movement. We believe this will spur the evolution of new civic innovations capable of addressing societyâ€™s most significant challenges.

        thirdDescription: `Orcasound is a network that connects live hydrophones (underwater microphones) monitoring the habitat of endangered orcas with citizen scientists, educational environmental non-profits, and machine learning algorithms. The new web-based Orcasound app (launched November 1, 2018) makes it easy to listen for whales -- both for their amazing orca sounds and for noise that may be detrimental to them -- by using HTTP Live Streaming (and eventually MPEG-DASH). These formats optimize playback performance over a wide range of browser/device combinations within the Orcasound web-app that plays a live audio stream. [The backend is an Elixir app using the Phoenix framework. The Phoenix app serves a React app.] The app enables citizen scientists to monitor the acoustic environment of the whales and report when they hear the orcas call, whistle, or click, or when they hear other important signals. These human detections help prioritize signals to be classified through machine learning, using the lossless uncompressed data that is also transmitted to AWS S3 bucket from each hydrophone. Synergy between human and machine detection, classification, and eventually acoustic and visual localization will not only facilitate basic research into the communication and echolocation systems of fish-eating killer whales and other local marine species, but also will enhance many other research and educational activities with the potential to help the orcas recover. These activities include: live-listening outreach activities at the Seattle Aquarium and educational facilities of Orcasound members; NOAA studies of orca health and diet; mitigation of human-caused noise -- like pile driving at Washington State Ferry docks; & oil spill prevention and response. Over the long term, Orcasound data will help assess noise levels throughout the killer whales' critical habitat and identify the most persistent sources of noise pollution at the frequencies used by marine mammals for vital activities like foraging and reproduction. Thus, to help save the endangered southern resident killer whales, we need a wide spectrum of volunteers: developers (for software -- at the hydrophone node, in the app, and for real-time cloud-based data analysis), beta-tester citizen scientists, user researchers, designers, and data hackers. Hackathon challenges include: optimize low-latency audio data acquisition and the upload script on the Raspberry Pi to improve player performance in the app; prioritize key features for beta-testing and implement a cycle of testing and refining them; develop an administrative interface (login, CMS, detection moderation, notifications); integrate a map view of hydrophone locations into the UI; clarify and begin implementing machine learning architecture and data pipelines; test mechanisms for real-time analysis, including visualization of audio data as a spectrogram, annotations from human or machine classifications, and quantification of noise statistics.`

Culture shocks can be funny, stressful, annoying or scary. When culture shocks are not dealt with properly they can lead to negative psychological and physiological effects, such as isolation, homesickness, depression, and hostility towards the host nation. 

        Culture Shock is an app that helps people deal with culture shocks by letting them process unfamiliar things that are happening to them in a safer and more positive environment.

Let's make city councils actions and activities more discoverable. The first step to this is basic data processing: automated transcript creation for city council events, indexing those transcripts, and finally making them available on the web via our website and database.\
        But what more can we do? Add more cities to the system? What about visualizations about topics covered by the city council? How about building predictive models for city council decisions and actions? Or even, summarizing city council member positions on topics? All of these and more are projects we are curious about, but if you have your own ideas we are glad to hear them.`
